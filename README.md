# Bank Kata Project

## Overview

The Bank Kata Project is a Java-based implementation of a simplified banking system. This project demonstrates core banking operations and serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming principles in Java. The system is designed to be easily extendable and modifiable for further development or educational purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Make (optional, for build automation)

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/werrahma/bank-kata.git
cd bank-kata


### Building and Running the Project

The project includes a Makefile for simplified build and cleanup processes. Use the following commands to compile and run the program:

- To compile and run the project:
  bash
  make


- To clean up compiled .class files:
  bash
  make clean

### Customizing and Testing

To modify or extend the functionality of the banking system, navigate to the bankkata/Main.java file. This file contains the main entry point of the application and can be edited to include additional test cases or scenarios.
